# **Pyber-Analysis**

### Introduction & Background
In this dataset, rideshare data was examined for the impact of city type (urban, suburban, and rural) on trends in total fares, total rides, number of drivers, average fare per number of rides, and average fare per number of drivers (2019). This resembles what a data analyst may encounter in the **Transportation Mobility as a Service** industry. Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the Matplotlib and Pandas modules, this analysis was a breeze. As a result I feel prepared to create intuitive dataframes and plots to best express specific trends with real world data.

### Method and Results
Using the Pandas library, I began by importing two .csv files, which I would combine and transform to create the dataframe below (city and ride data).


### Analysis
Despite having smaller budgets on average, charter highschool students outperformed public highschool students in subjects of reading and mathematics. An investigateion into class structure, educator hiring pools, and curriculum between school types would be necessary to better understand the root cause of this score gap.
