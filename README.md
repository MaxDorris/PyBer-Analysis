# **Pyber-Analysis**

### Introduction & Background
In this dataset, rideshare data was examined for the impact of city type (urban, suburban, and rural) on trends in total fares, total rides, number of drivers, average fare per number of rides, and average fare per number of drivers (2019). This resembles what a data analyst may encounter in the **Transportation Mobility as a Service** industry.

### Budget by School Type and Grade
Public high schools had higher budgets for each grade level (9th-12th) than charter high schools.

### Analysis
Despite having smaller budgets on average, charter highschool students outperformed public highschool students in subjects of reading and mathematics. An investigateion into class structure, educator hiring pools, and curriculum between school types would be necessary to better understand the root cause of this score gap.
